### What is Stored Procedures?
 - A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements stored in the database. It can be executed multiple times with different parameters, allowing for efficient reuse of logic, reduced duplication, and better performance.
 - Stored procedures support input parameters, allow encapsulation of logic, and can perform a wide range of operations like data manipulation, validation, transactions, and reporting.
